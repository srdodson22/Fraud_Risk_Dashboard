# Fraud Risk Dashboard – Excel Case Study

## Project Type
Individual Portfolio Project

## Problem
Financial institutions face ongoing threats from fraudulent transactions. Early identification of suspicious patterns is essential to prevent loss and protect consumers. While advanced tools exist for detecting anomalies, analysts should also be able to develop actionable solutions using accessible tools like Excel.

This project demonstrates how Excel can be utilized to develop a rule-based fraud risk scoring system, analyze transactional patterns, and present insights through a clean and interactive dashboard.

## Objectives
- Create a rule-based fraud risk scoring system
- Use Excel to visualize transaction patterns and flag risky activity
- Design a user-friendly, interactive dashboard

## Tools & Features
**Microsoft Excel**
- PivotTables & PivotCharts  
- Conditional Formatting  
- IF Statements & Calculated Columns  
- Slicers for interactive filtering  
- Data visualization and storytelling  

## Dataset Overview
- 200 synthetic financial transactions
- Key fields: transaction ID, customer name, amount, country, transaction type, time of day, and previous fraud flags
- Dataset was pre-cleaned and structured for Excel analysis

## Fraud Scoring Logic
- Score based on:
  - Transaction amount thresholds
  - Risky transaction types (e.g., wire transfers)
  - Time-of-day indicators (e.g., after-hours transactions)
  - High-risk countries
- Scoring automated using Excel formulas
- Conditional formatting is used to categorize risk visually

## Dashboard Design
- Interactive Excel dashboard includes:
  - Bar charts for fraud risk level distribution and transaction type analysis
  - Donut chart visualizing domestic vs. foreign transactions
  - Time-based trends in transaction risk
- Slicers allow stakeholders to filter and explore patterns in real time

## Structure & Organization
- **Raw Data**: Stored on a separate worksheet  
- **Calculations**: Conducted on structured pivot and formula worksheets  
- **Dashboard**: Isolated on a clean, polished sheet with an intuitive color palette and layout

## Key Insights
- ~6% of transactions were flagged with the highest risk score (5)
- Wire transactions and late afternoon/early evening activities showed higher risk patterns

## Outcome
This project demonstrates how structured logic and Excel’s built-in tools can effectively support fraud detection. It highlights my ability to:
- Design rule-based scoring systems
- Build clear, actionable dashboards
- Communicate findings in an accessible and professional format

## Future Improvements
- Scale dataset to 500+ transactions
- Rebuild using SQL or Python for enhanced automation and modeling
- Explore machine learning for automated anomaly detection
